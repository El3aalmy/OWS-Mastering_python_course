# --- What is OOP ? 
# Python support object oriented programming 
# OOP is a paradigm or coding style 
# Paradigm => means structuring program so the methods(functions) and attributes(data) and bundled into object
# Methods => act as functoin that use the information of the object
# Python is multi-paradigm programming language (procedural, OPP, functional)
# procedural => structure app like recips, sets of steps to make the task
# functional => built on the concept of mathematical functions
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --- Why OPP ? 
# OPP allow you to organize your code and make it readable and reusable
# Every thing in python is object
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --- If man is object 
# Attributes => name, age, adress, phone number, info(can be different)
# Methods(behaviors) => whalking, eating, playing
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# --- If car is object 
# Attributes => model, color, price, date made
# Methods(behaviors) => walking, stopping
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --- Class 
# Class is the template for creating objects(object constructor | blueprint)
# Class car can create many cars object
# Class user can create many users object
